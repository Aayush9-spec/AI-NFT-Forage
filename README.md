# AI NFT Forage

*A quick preview of the app*

## 🚀 Overview  
AI NFT Forage is a web application that lets users generate NFTs from text prompts using AI — and then mint, manage or explore those NFTs on-chain. The goal is to make the process of "prompt → AI art → NFT" streamlined, fun, and accessible.

## 🔍 Features  
- Enter a text prompt and generate AI artwork.  
- Preview the generated artwork in the browser.  
- Mint the generated artwork as an NFT (connect a crypto wallet, choose network, etc).  
- Explore minted NFTs (gallery view, metadata display).  
- Support for Web3 wallet integration (e.g., MetaMask / WalletConnect) and blockchain interactions.  
- Responsive UI built with modern JS frameworks.

## 🧩 Tech Stack  
- Frontend: (e.g., React / Next.js)  
- AI generation: integration with an AI-image creation API or model.  
- Blockchain / Web3: smart contract interactions (e.g., ERC-721 or ERC-1155), wallet connection.  
- Deployment: Hosted on Vercel (as seen at `ai-nft-forage.vercel.app`).  
- Styling: (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Styled Components, etc)  
- Optional: IPFS or other decentralized storage for artwork & metadata.

## 📦 Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
- Node.js (v14+ recommended)  
- Yarn or npm  
- A supported Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) connected to your desired network  
- Blockchain network configuration & contract address if you are minting NFTs  
- (Optional) AI-image generation API key / service credentials  

### Installation  
1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-nft-forage.git  
   cd ai-nft-forage
   
   
2. Install dependencies
npm install  
# or  
yarn install  


3. Create a .env.local file (or whichever your project uses) and add environment variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_ai_api_key_here  
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourContractAddress  
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=1          # or the network you use

 
4. Run locally
npm run dev  
# or  
yarn dev  
Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.


Deployment

This project is configured for Vercel deployment. To deploy:
Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel.
Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard.
Push your repository; Vercel will build & deploy automatically.
Your live URL will be similar to https://ai-nft-forage.vercel.app.


🧪 Usage
On the home page, enter a prompt describing the artwork you want (e.g., “a futuristic neon city skyline at dusk”).
Click “Generate” to create an image via the AI service.
Once the image displays, connect your wallet and choose “Mint NFT”.
Confirm transaction in your wallet.
Navigate to the gallery to see your minted NFT (along with metadata, token ID, link to Etherscan or other explorer).
Share or showcase your minted NFTs.


🧠 Architecture & Flow
User enters prompt → frontend sends request to AI service → receives image URL or binary.
Frontend uploads image + metadata to decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS) or a conventional storage solution.
Frontend triggers smart contract mint function (NFT contract).
Transaction completes → token ID minted and details (owner, metadata URL) stored on-chain.
Gallery component reads contract (via Web3) and fetches metadata to render tokens.


✅ Why Use This Project?
Bridges the gap between AI-generated art and blockchain/NFT minting.
Simplifies the user journey from creative prompt to owned digital asset.
Great base for extending features: royalty settings, multiple chains, generative collections, marketplaces.
Showcase of full-stack Web3 + AI workflow.


🛠️ Extending the Project
Add support for multiple AI models (e.g., DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney-style).
Integrate other blockchain networks (Polygon, Solana, BNB Chain).
Implement royalties, metadata standards, lazy-minting.
Include user profiles, collections, analytics dashboard.
Deploy your own smart contract or integrate a ready-made drop system.
